# Carousel Example  
  
This example demonstrates a simple carousel using FastHTML and MonsterUI. The carousel allows users to navigate through a series of images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.  
  
## How It Works  
  
1. **Carousel Component**: The `Carousel` function creates a carousel component with images and navigation buttons.  
2. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript functions `nextSlide` and `prevSlide` handle the sliding functionality of the carousel.  
3. **Images**: Sample images are used to demonstrate the carousel. You can replace these images with your own.  
  
## Usage  
  
To use this carousel in your FastHTML app, you can copy the `Carousel` function and the JavaScript code into your app and customize the images as needed.
