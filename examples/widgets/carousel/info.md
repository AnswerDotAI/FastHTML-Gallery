# Carousel Example  
  
This example demonstrates a simple carousel using FastHTML. The carousel allows users to navigate through a series of images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.  
  
## How It Works  
  
1. **Carousel Component**: The carousel is created using the `Div` and `Img` components from FastHTML, along with navigation buttons for user interaction.  
2. **JavaScript**: The JavaScript functions `nextSlide` and `prevSlide` manage the sliding functionality of the carousel, allowing users to cycle through images.  
3. **Images**: Sample images are provided to demonstrate the carousel. You can easily replace these images with your own by updating the `src` attributes.  
  
## Usage  
  
To use this carousel in your FastHTML app, copy the carousel implementation code, including the JavaScript functionality, into your app. Customize the images as needed to fit your project requirements.
