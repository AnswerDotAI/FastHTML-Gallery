# Bloch Spheres

In classical computing a bit can be only 0 or 1. In quantum computing a quantum bit (qubit) is a vector with 2 complex numbers, which can be visualized in 3D. Like in classical computing, gates are used to change the qubit state, but in quantum computing gates act as rotations. 

This visualization lets you explore quantum gates and learn how to control qubits. This is an essential skill for programming quantum computers.
