# Tic Tac Toe Web App

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using FastHTML, HTMX, and Tailwind CSS built by Adedara Adeloro. It demonstrates modern web development techniques with a focus on server-side rendering and minimal JavaScript.

The build steps from the original project were simplifed to use CDNs for the FastHTML Gallery examples.  To check out the original project, click [here](https://github.com/TechBroAdedara/TicTacToe-with-FastHTML)

## Key Technologies and Techniques

1. **FastHTML**: A Python-based framework for building web applications with a focus web fundamentals
2. **HTMX**: HTMX is used to create the dynamic server-side content updates that lets you interact with the app without page reloads.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind classes are used throughout the HTML to style the app, providing a clean and responsive design. For example `cls="grid grid-cols-3 grid-rows-3` creates a 3x3 grid for the Tic Tac Toe board. 

## How It Works

### Server-Side Logic

The app uses FastHTML to define routes and handle game logic on the server. Key routes include:

- `/`: The main page that renders the initial game board.
- `/on_click`: Handles player moves and updates the game state.
- `/restart`: Resets the game board.

### State Management

The game state is managed server-side using global variables:

- `button_states`: A 2D array storing snapshots of the board.
- `current_state_index`: Tracks the current state of the game.
- `winner_found_game_ended`: A flag to indicate if the game has ended.

### Dynamic Content

HTMX is used extensively to create a dynamic user interface

- `hx-get` attributes on buttons trigger GET server requests on click.
- `hx-target` specifies where the response from the server should be put.
- `hx-swap` determines how the new content should replace the old content.  In this app `outerHTML` is used to replace the entire element.
